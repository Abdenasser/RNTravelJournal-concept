## Overview

‚ö†Ô∏è **I created this little side project in order to learn some basic React Native UI elements/components and to see how far I can go with them, and it turns out that those few basic elements are by far enough to make any complex component you can imagine**

**This project only includes a few screens all made out of reusable components.** that you can start using in your own React Native projects with no need to include any 3rd party ui frameworks or libraries.

- **Great looking** ü§ò
- **Made with Expo** ‚ö°
- **TypeScript supported** üåû

This project was inspired by this [amazing piece of art on Dribbble](https://dribbble.com/shots/15004647). Feel free to show some appreciation to the designer.
